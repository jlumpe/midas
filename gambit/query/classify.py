def consensus_taxon(taxa: Iterable[Taxon]) -> Tuple[Optional[Taxon], Set[Taxon]]:
	"""Take a set of taxa matching a query and find a single consensus taxon for classification.

	If a query matches a given taxon, it is expected that there may be hits on some of its ancestors
	as well. In this case all taxa lie in a single lineage and the most specific taxon will be the
	consensus.

	It may also be possible for a query to match multiple taxa which are "inconsistent" with each
	other in the sense that one is not a descendant of the other. In that case the consensus will be
	the lowest taxon which is either a descendant or ancestor of all taxa in the argument. It's also
	possible in pathological cases (depending on reference database design) that the taxa may be
	within entirely different trees, in which case the consensus will be ``None``. The second
	element of the returned tuple is the set of taxa in the argument which are strict descendants of
	the consensus. This set will contain at least two taxa in the case of such an inconsistency and
	be empty otherwise.

	Parameters
	----------
	taxa : Iterable[Taxon]

	Returns
	-------
	Tuple[Optional[Taxon], List[Taxon]]
		Consensus taxon along with subset of ``taxa`` which are not an ancestor of it.
