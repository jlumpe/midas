Pre-calculated k-mer sets in coordinate format for a selection of 25 real
bacterial genomes. 15 genomes are from E. coli, 5 are from Staphylococcus
aureus, and 5 are from Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Parameters used to extract k-mers were prefix = 'ATGAC' and k = 11.

Files:

* accs.txt -- accession numbers of genomes, one per line.
* coords.pickle -- pickled list of numpy arrays containing k-mer
  coordinates for genomes.
